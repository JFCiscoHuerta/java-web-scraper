*WebScrapper* is a Java-based tool designed to scrape and collect data from web pages using Jsoup. This scraper allows you to extract various elements, such as titles (h1, h2, h3, h4), links, and any other specific elements defined by CSS selectors. 

The tool supports connection retries in case of failures, and it provides functionality to save the scraped data to a file. Customize the scraper by providing a user agent and target URL to start gathering data from any website.
